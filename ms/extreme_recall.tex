In November 2013, we recruited 344 survey participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk \citep[see][]{berinsky2012}. (See \ref{si_survey_dem} for a description of how we processed this data, and comparison to population benchmarks.) We asked the respondents, ``When you think about the Democratic (Republican) party, which political leader(s) first come to mind? Name up to three.'' We followed the open-ended question with a multiple-choice question that presented respondents a list of names and photos of political leaders and asked the respondents ``Is there another political leader that you haven't mentioned already who immediately comes to mind when you think about the Democratic (Republican) party?'' Among the Democrats, people choose between, Joseph Biden, Barney Frank, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Ted Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kerry, John Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi, Al Gore, Barack Obama. And among Republicans, between, Paul Ryan, John McCain, Paul Rand, Sarah Palin, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, John Boehner, Jeb Bush, Michele Bachmann, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Eric Cantor, Mitt Romney, and Mitch McConnell. We paired the responses with CF-Scores \citep{bonica2013}.

We find that people are likelier to recall prominent politicians (see Figure \ref{fig:fig5}). On average, the people recall politicians who are no more extreme than the median member of Congress. For instance, recalled politicians are more extreme than the Senate mean just 55.6\% of the times. And the average difference to the Senate means is a mere .017 (see \ref{tab:tab1}). (For comparison, the standard deviation of CF-scores within the parties in the Senate is about .3.) People do recall more extreme politicians earlier but again the bias is substantively not particularly large. However, people tend to \textit{think} that these relatively moderate politicians are ideologically extreme (see \ref{si_recall}). Thus, the bias may be less in who is covered in the media, and more about how they are covered.

\section{Survey data}

Because the answers to the politician recall survey questions were open-ended (respondents typed in names), the responses were quite ``noisy'' (in addition to misspellings, some respondents just used last names, some just first names, etc) so we had to take several steps to address this.  First, we restricted attention to politicians whose exact name was used at least 3 times for at least one of the recall questions (these are the politicians listed in \ref{fig:fig1}). Then, to determine whether other respondents were attempting to refer to these politicians, we checked whether the respondent referred to the same last name (for unique last names), common misspellings of the last or first names (oboma, reed, hilary), and common stems for very difficult to spell names (boe or boh for boehner, mccon for mcconnell).  There were two non-unique last names, Bush and Clinton.  For the two Bushes: we coded any responses with 2nd, 3rd 4th or 5th word starting with s (for senior), or 2nd-3rd-4th starting with H (for middle initials H.W.) as 'george bush' and code all other responses as 'george w bush'. We coded responses of just 'clinton' as 'bill clinton'.  Regarding positions, we coded each politician as 'executive', 'legislative' or 'governor'.  We included all party nominees (president or vice president) as executive.  Failed candidates for party nomination are included in other categories.
